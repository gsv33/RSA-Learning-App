To Do List (please write detailed bug descriptions!)

Issues from physical device test
- Remove unnecessary background colors now that it's in dark mode
- Add message if clicking "Reset" when primes are original in Explore Decode screen
- Enable Swipe to go back
- Too little padding between the error bar and the top of the screen
- "Done" button disappearing on Decode primes screen sometimes after first button click
    - Doesn't appear to happen on simulator (tested on iPhone 8, iPhone SE, iPhone 14)
    - Happening on physical device (iPhone 8)
- Need padding on title for Encoding/Decoding math popovers

To Do:
- Additional bugs in the wrong error message showing up
- sync color scheme across views
- Test on multiple devices (fix any bugs)
- Test character to number mapping title size on SE
- Reorder public key
- Right Align encoding/decoding math inputs in grid
- Bug: "Show number to letter mapping" doesn't animate when dismissed from the MessageToNumbers second view
- Should the decode button randomize the output?

Completed
x ** Primes must be distinct! Otherwise the math doesn't work**
x Set max acceptable digits in prime number
x Set separate error messages for when the inputs are not prime, or when they are but the primes are too long
x Combine checkInputsAreValid functions
x Fix animation bug in mod exponentiation
x Test RSA encryption/decryption with random messages
x Product of primes must have more than 1 digit
x Remove 00 from Character Encoding
x Test specific bug where padding at the end of the split encoded msg is an issue
x Add "What is RSA?" first page
x Fill in More Info sections
x How do we handle long animation times? (Show next button before animation is finished?)
    x Alternative page for encoding
x Bug: Sometimes the step-by-step button loads the explore rsa screen and vice versa
x Add reset button when user goes back to main menu
x No output for the decoded nums - blank screen displays
x Need separate rsa variables for Explore and Tutorial
x Proofread explanations
x Prime text fields should be numbers only
x Status bar is not visible
x Top of view should not be transparent/white when scrolling
x Change prime text fields view in dark mode
x Fix keyboard menu issue
x Check for line breaks in message field


Later
- add generate random message button
- Create automatic encoding and decoding updates for the ExploreRSA views
- If you set primes, then go back, then forward to the primes page, the primes are reset to 0
- Re-organize explanation code to one container view that the relevant text is passed in to
- Remove LazyVGrid and replace with regular grid
